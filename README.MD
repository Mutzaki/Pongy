## PONGY THE PONG GAME ##
# how to play ? #
1. press W to move up and S to move down.
2. Get 3 points by shooting the ball behind your enemy paddle.
3. the first one to get 3 goals wins. 

## WHAT I USED TO MAKE IT ##
an JS and CSS files that are exported in an HTML file, using funcions that Creates the game play. makes the paddels, ball move and keeps the ball inside the field. also a startGame function and endGame fucntion that let you start , win/lose and finish and after that restart the game again. 
look at the code and let me know if you see anything that need and improvements or if you have other better ways to create this game !
